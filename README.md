Robotics project implementing IR communication through MSP430FR6989 microcontrollers

IR Communication works through the repeated turning on and off of an IR LED at 38 kHz in order to transfer information. This blinking is formatted in a way that the receiver is able to decode and obtain meaningful information from it.
Followed a “gap” (Certain No. of Cycles) between bits as specified by the receiver’s specifications.
